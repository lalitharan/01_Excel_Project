# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project is to analyze how different types of campaign performed based on their launch dates and funded goals.
The analysis of outcomes (Successful,Failed,Canceled) based on launch dates for the theatre category and the analysis of outcomes based on goal amount
for the "Play" subcategory.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to apply the skills learned to create pivot tables and pivot charts and visualize data for analysis purposes.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the chart, the month of May has the most successful outcome for the theater category, followed by June. The least successful month is December.
Months of May,June,July and August has almost the same number of failed campaigns

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

76% of the campaigns for plays are successful for the goal amount of less that $1000 and 73% of the campaign is successful for the goal amount range of 1000 to 4999.Then the graph tapers down for the success rates as the goal amount increases till $35000.Interesting to note that 67% of the plays are successful for the goal range of $35000 to $44999, but the total number of projects in that goal range is only 9.
88% of the projects failed when the goal amount is greater than $50000.There are no canceled campaigns for the plays.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Based on the kickstarter data set, we can create other visualizations charts for analysis for any category of interest and/or any other country.
